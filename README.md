# Hotel-Data-Analysis

In this project I developed a database in MySQL to analyze and visual hotel data using PowerBI. In this exploratory analysis, I looked for insights and trends to answer three business questions:

1. Is revenue growing by year?
2. Is an additional guest parking lot needed?
3. What additional are any trends?

The data pipline:
1. Build a database
2. Develop SQL Query
3. Connect PowerBI to the database
4. Visualize findings to stakeholders
